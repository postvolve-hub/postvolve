UPDATE: PostVolve Landing Page (V2 - SEO, Trust, and Polish)

Goal: Update the existing PostVolve landing page (index.html) to include richer SEO-focused content, a Social Proof section for conversion, and implement premium, subtle animations across all interactive elements.

Required Technology: Use modern HTML and Tailwind CSS. Do not introduce any custom CSS that isn't absolutely necessary; rely on Tailwind utility classes for animations and styling.

Design Structure and Content Changes

The page must maintain the existing structure (Header, Hero, Features, Pricing) and insert the two new SEO-focused sections.

1. Header/Navigation

Links: Update navigation to include: "Features", "How It Works" (New link/section anchor), "Pricing", "Contact".

2. Hero Section

Content: No changes to copy or layout needed.

3. NEW SECTION (High-SEO Value: Content Categories)

Anchor Tag: Place this section before the main Feature Section and give it an anchor link: #how-it-works.

Section Title: Content That Establishes You as an Expert

Subhead: Our engine focuses exclusively on the high-value niches that drive professional engagement and network growth.

Content Cards (4 Cards, 2x2 Grid on desktop, Stacked on mobile):

Card 1: AI & Emerging Tech: Curated summaries on LLMs, automation, and deep learning trends.

Card 2: Business & Finance: Market analysis, startup strategy, and investment insights.

Card 3: Breaking Tech News: Timely, concise updates on hardware, software, and industry shifts.

Card 4: Motivational & Leadership: High-impact quotes and principles for personal and professional development.

Animation Directive: Apply the premium hover effects (scale-up and shadow increase) to these cards.

4. Feature Section: The Content Automation Loop

Content: No changes to copy needed.

Animation Directive: Apply the premium hover effects (scale-up and shadow increase) to these cards.

5. NEW SECTION (Trust & Conversion: Social Proof)

Section Title (Center-aligned): Trusted by Thought Leaders in Tech

Content: Create a dedicated, centered testimonial block beneath the Feature Section.

Block Style: A simple, high-contrast quote card with a light background and subtle shadow.

Placeholder Quote: "PostVolve gave me back 10 hours a week and immediately doubled my impression count. Essential for building authority."

Attribution: [Placeholder Name], CEO of Innovation Labs.

Trust Bar: Include a simple row of placeholder logos (e.g., small gray circles or squares) labeled "As featured in: TechCrunch, Forbes, Fast Company, MIT Tech Review" for perceived trust.

6. Pricing Section

Animation Directive: Apply the premium hover effects (scale-up and shadow increase) to the non-highlighted pricing cards.

Summary of Key Directives (V2 Polish)

Layout & Content: Integrate the two new sections (Content Categories & Social Proof) into the existing flow.

Color Palette: Maintain the clean white/light gray background with Purple (#6D28D9) and Dark Blue (#1E3A8A) accents.

Tailwind CSS: Use Tailwind for all styling.

Premium Animation (CRITICAL):

Global Transition: Ensure all interactive/hoverable elements (a, button, cards) have transition-all duration-300 for smoothness.

Card Hover Effect: Feature cards, Content Category cards, and Pricing Cards (except the already-scaled 'Professional' tier) must use a subtle hover:scale-[1.02] combined with an increased shadow like hover:shadow-2xl.

Button Polish: Buttons must have clear :hover states with background color shifts and subtle shadow changes.
